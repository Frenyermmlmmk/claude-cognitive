## The Problem

Claude Code is powerful but stateless. Every new instance:
- **Rediscovers** your codebase from scratch
- **Hallucinates** integrations that don't exist
- **Repeats** debugging you already tried
- **Burns tokens** re-reading unchanged files

With large codebases (50k+ lines), this becomes painful fast.

---

## The Solution

**Claude Cognitive** gives Claude Code working memory through two complementary systems:

### 1. Context Router
**Attention-based file injection** with cognitive dynamics:
- **HOT** (>0.8): Full file injection - active development
- **WARM** (0.25-0.8): Headers only - background awareness
- **COLD** (<0.25): Evicted from context

Files **decay** when not mentioned, **activate** on keywords, and **co-activate** with related files.

### 2. Pool Coordinator
**Multi-instance state sharing** for long-running sessions:
- **Automatic mode**: Detects completions/blockers from conversation (every 5min)
- **Manual mode**: Explicit `pool` blocks for critical coordination
- Works with persistent sessions (days/weeks), not just short bursts

---

## Results

**Token Savings:**
- Cold start: **79%** (120K → 25K chars)
- Warm context: **70%** (80K → 24K chars)
- Focused work: **75%** (60K → 15K chars)

**Average: 64-95% depending on codebase size and work pattern.**

**Developer Experience:**
- ✅ New instances productive in **first message**
- ✅ Zero hallucinated imports/integrations
- ✅ No duplicate work across 8+ concurrent instances
- ✅ Persistent memory across days-long sessions

**Validated on:**
- 1+ million line production codebase (3,200+ Python modules)
- 4-node distributed architecture
- 8 concurrent Claude Code instances
- Multi-day persistent sessions

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Scripts

```bash
# Clone to your home directory
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/GMaN1911/claude-cognitive.git .claude-cognitive

# Copy scripts
cp -r .claude-cognitive/scripts ~/.claude/scripts/

# Set up hooks (adds to existing config)
cat .claude-cognitive/hooks-config.json >> ~/.claude/settings.json
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create .claude directory
mkdir -p .claude/{systems,modules,integrations,pool}

# Copy templates
cp ~/.claude-cognitive/templates/* .claude/

# Edit .claude/CLAUDE.md with your project info
# Edit .claude/systems/*.md to describe your architecture
```

### 3. Set Instance ID

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc for persistence:
export CLAUDE_INSTANCE=A

# Or per-terminal:
export CLAUDE_INSTANCE=B
```

### 4. Verify It's Working

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# First message - check for context injection:
# Should see: "ATTENTION STATE [Turn 1]" with HOT/WARM/COLD counts

# Query pool activity:
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/pool-query.py --since 1h
```

### 5. Customize Keywords (Optional, Recommended)

**The scripts work immediately with MirrorBot example keywords** (50-70% savings).

**For 80-95% savings:** Customize keywords to match your codebase.

**Quick customization:**
```bash
# Edit the keyword section
nano ~/.claude/scripts/context-router-v2.py

# See full guide:
cat ~/.claude-cognitive/CUSTOMIZATION.md
```

**Customization guide:** [CUSTOMIZATION.md](./CUSTOMIZATION.md)

## How It Works

### Context Router

**Attention Dynamics:**
```
User mentions "orin" in message
    ↓
systems/orin.md → score = 1.0 (HOT)
    ↓
Co-activation:
  integrations/pipe-to-orin.md → +0.35 (WARM)
  modules/t3-telos.md → +0.35 (WARM)
    ↓
Next turn (no mention):
  systems/orin.md → 1.0 × 0.85 decay = 0.85 (still HOT)
    ↓
3 turns later (no mention):
  systems/orin.md → 0.85 × 0.85 × 0.85 = 0.61 (now WARM)
```

**Injection:**
- HOT files: Full content injected
- WARM files: First 25 lines (headers) injected
- COLD files: Not injected (evicted)

### Pool Coordinator

**Automatic Mode:**
```
Instance A completes task
    ↓
Auto-detector finds: "Successfully deployed PPE to Orin"
    ↓
Writes pool entry:
  action: completed
  topic: PPE deployment to Orin
  affects: orin_sensory_cortex/
    ↓
Instance B starts session
    ↓
Pool loader shows:
  "[A] completed: PPE deployment to Orin"
    ↓
Instance B avoids duplicate work
```

**Manual Mode:**
````markdown
```pool
INSTANCE: A
ACTION: completed
TOPIC: Fixed authentication bug
SUMMARY: Resolved race condition in token refresh. Added mutex.
AFFECTS: auth.py, session_handler.py
BLOCKS: Session management refactor can proceed
```
````

```

**Hooks:**
- `UserPromptSubmit`: Context router + pool auto-update
- `SessionStart`: Pool loader
- `Stop`: Pool extractor (manual blocks)

**State Files:**
- `.claude/attn_state.json` - Context router scores
- `.claude/pool/instance_state.jsonl` - Pool entries

**Strategy:** Project-local first, `~/.claude/` fallback (monorepo-friendly)

## Use Cases

### Solo Developer - Large Codebase
**Problem:** 50k+ line Python project, Claude forgets architecture between sessions

**Solution:**
- Context router keeps architecture docs HOT when mentioned
- Token usage drops 79% (120K → 25K chars)
- New sessions productive immediately

### Team - Monorepo
**Problem:** 4 developers, each running Claude in different terminals, duplicate work

**Solution:**
- Each dev sets `CLAUDE_INSTANCE=A/B/C/D`
- Pool coordinator shares completions/blockers
- Zero duplicate debugging

### Long-Running Sessions
**Problem:** Keep Claude open for days, it forgets what happened 2 days ago

**Solution:**
- Pool auto-updates write history continuously
- Context router maintains attention across days
- Temporal coherence preserved
